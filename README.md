# Code Exam Training Repository

Welcome to the **Code Exam Training Repository**! This repository is part of a personal project to build a website as part of a training exercise in preparation for a code exam. The website's design is based on an inspirational travel website UI design from Dribbble.

## Project Overview

In this project, I am building a travel-themed website from scratch following the design example found on Dribbble. The aim is to practice various web development skills such as **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **responsive design**.

### Inspiration

The website design inspiration comes from the following Dribbble shot:

[Travel Website UI by Ryan Walker](https://dribbble.com/shots/22204035-Travel-Website-UI)

This Dribbble shot features a clean, modern travel website design that emphasizes usability, user experience, and aesthetics. My goal is to replicate the design as closely as possible, while adding my own coding improvements and learning throughout the process.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website will be fully responsive, ensuring an optimal experience across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Modern UI**: Inspired by the Dribbble design, the website will feature a visually appealing interface with travel-themed elements.
- **Clean Code**: The project aims to follow best practices in web development with semantic HTML, modular CSS, and efficient JavaScript.
- **Interactive Elements**: Elements such as sliders, animations, and a dynamic navigation bar will be included to enhance the user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling, with a focus on responsive design techniques.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and dynamic content.
- **Version Control**: Managed via Git and hosted on GitHub.

## Why This Project?

The purpose of this project is to simulate a real-world scenario of building a modern, user-friendly website based on a provided design. This allows me to practice:
- **Frontend development skills**.
- **Converting a UI design into code**.
- **Improving my problem-solving abilities in preparation for a coding exam**.
